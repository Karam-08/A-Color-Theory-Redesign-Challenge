The website that I redesigned was an old website called McSpotlight. 
The website is very old, with the last update being in the early 2000’s. 
The color scheme is alright, red and yellow do contrast with each other. Though, monochromatic red seemed to fit the theme more. Red shows danger, which is a key part of the website. McSpotlight is trying to show that McDonalds is dangerous through the McLibel trial. When you add yellow (which is a symbol of Joy and Sunshine), it makes the red more about passion and love. So the color scheme was changed to be Monochromatic red for that reason.

The website itself needed more work. There was no header or footer within the website, so that needed to be added . The mailing list was put off to the side instead of being in the center. The same thing happened with the description text. The link for people that were “New to the site” felt unnecessary, so it was removed. This is supposed to be the homepage, so the explanation for what the site is about should be on the homepage. There were links with a cool spotlight effect when you hovered over them. Links that lead to other pages should be on the navigation bar. Although the effect was nice, it had to be removed. Contact information was put inside of the footer, and each important thing had their own sections, with borders and a different background color.

The hardest part was the footer. Figuring out how to spread out the images evenly was hard, and putting the link at the bottom was hard too. Making the mailing list section was the hardest part. Adjusting the width and making the link for the mailing list wasn’t fun. Other than that, everything else was relatively easy.
